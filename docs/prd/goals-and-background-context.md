# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- **G1**: Create a functional calculator application with basic arithmetic operations
- **G2**: Integrate BMAD framework for project management and development workflow
- **G3**: Establish a robust development environment with proper documentation
- **G4**: Implement a clean, maintainable codebase following best practices

## Background Context
This project aims to develop a calculator application while leveraging the BMAD (Business, Marketing, Architecture, Development) framework for comprehensive project management. The calculator will serve as a foundation project to demonstrate the BMAD workflow and provide a practical implementation example. The project includes documentation structures, development standards, and architectural patterns that can be reused for future projects.
