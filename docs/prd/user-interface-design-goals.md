# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Create a clean, intuitive terminal interface that provides immediate feedback and maintains calculation history. The interface should be accessible to both technical users and those unfamiliar with command-line tools, with clear prompts and helpful error messages.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Interactive Mode**: Users enter calculations one at a time with immediate results
- **Batch Mode**: Users can provide calculations as command-line arguments
- **History Navigation**: Users can access previous calculations during the session
- **Clear Prompts**: Always show current state and expected input format
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Informative error messages that guide users to correct input

## Core Screens and Views
- **Main Calculator Interface**: Primary interactive calculation screen
- **Help Screen**: Display available commands and usage examples
- **History View**: Show session calculation history
- **Settings/Configuration**: Display current calculator settings and modes

## Accessibility: Terminal Standards
- High contrast default terminal colors
- Clear, readable text formatting
- Consistent prompt structure
- Screen reader compatible output
- Keyboard-only navigation support

## Branding
Minimal terminal branding with:
- Application name and version on startup
- Clean, professional appearance
- Optional ASCII art or colored text for visual interest
- Consistent formatting throughout

## Target Device and Platforms: Terminal Applications
- Linux Terminal (various shells)
- macOS Terminal/iTerm2
- Windows Command Prompt/PowerShell
- Cross-platform compatibility with standard ANSI escape codes
