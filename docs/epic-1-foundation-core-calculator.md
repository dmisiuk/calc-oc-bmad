# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Calculator

**Goal**: Establish project setup, basic calculation engine, and command-line interface infrastructure while delivering a functional basic calculator that users can immediately use for basic arithmetic operations.

## Story 1.1: Project Initialization [PRIORITY: HIGH] [PARALLEL]
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the Go project structure with proper module initialization,
**so that** I have a solid foundation for development and can leverage Go's package management.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Go module initialized with proper go.mod file
2. Basic project directory structure created
3. Git repository initialized with conventional commit setup
4. Basic README.md with project description and setup instructions
5. Initial .gitignore file configured for Go projects
6. GitHub repository created and linked

## Story 1.2: Core Calculation Engine [PRIORITY: HIGH] [PARALLEL with 1.1]
**As a** user,
**I want** a reliable calculation engine that performs basic arithmetic operations accurately,
**so that** I can trust the calculator for everyday mathematical calculations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Addition operation implemented with proper handling of decimal numbers
2. Subtraction operation implemented with negative number support
3. Multiplication operation implemented with precision handling
4. Division operation implemented with division-by-zero error handling
5. All operations maintain 15-digit precision accuracy
6. Unit tests covering all basic operations with edge cases

## Story 1.3: Basic Command-Line Interface [PRIORITY: HIGH] [SEQUENTIAL: after 1.2]
**As a** user,
**I want** a simple command-line interface to enter calculations and see results,
**so that** I can easily use the calculator without complex setup.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Interactive mode with clear input prompt
2. Real-time calculation display
3. Basic error messages for invalid input
4. Support for standard mathematical notation (+, -, *, /)
5. Clean output formatting
6. Exit command to terminate the application

## Story 1.4: Basic Error Handling [PRIORITY: MEDIUM] [SEQUENTIAL: after 1.3]
**As a** user,
**I want** clear error messages when I make mistakes,
**so that** I understand what went wrong and can correct my input.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Invalid input format detection and helpful error messages
2. Division by zero prevention with user-friendly explanation
3. Number overflow/underflow handling
4. Graceful handling of non-numeric input
5. Error recovery that allows continued use after errors
