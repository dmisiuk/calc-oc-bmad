# Calculator Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- **G1**: Create a functional calculator application with basic arithmetic operations
- **G2**: Integrate BMAD framework for project management and development workflow
- **G3**: Establish a robust development environment with proper documentation
- **G4**: Implement a clean, maintainable codebase following best practices

### Background Context
This project aims to develop a calculator application while leveraging the BMAD (Business, Marketing, Architecture, Development) framework for comprehensive project management. The calculator will serve as a foundation project to demonstrate the BMAD workflow and provide a practical implementation example. The project includes documentation structures, development standards, and architectural patterns that can be reused for future projects.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR1**: The calculator shall support basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- **FR2**: The calculator shall handle decimal numbers and floating-point arithmetic with command-line input
- **FR3**: The calculator shall provide clear console output for results and operations
- **FR4**: The calculator shall include error handling for invalid operations (e.g., division by zero) with informative error messages
- **FR5**: The calculator shall support keyboard input with intuitive command-line interface
- **FR6**: The calculator shall maintain calculation history session for user reference during runtime
- **FR7**: The calculator shall implement BMAD framework integration for development workflow
- **FR8**: The calculator shall support both interactive mode and command-line argument mode

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR1**: The application must respond to user input within 50ms (terminal apps should be faster than web)
- **NFR2**: The calculator must handle numbers up to 15 digits accurately
- **NFR3**: The terminal interface must be clean, readable, and provide clear prompts
- **NFR4**: The codebase must follow established coding standards and be thoroughly documented
- **NFR5**: The application must be built using appropriate terminal-friendly technologies with proper testing coverage
- **NFR6**: The project must integrate seamlessly with the BMAD framework for project management
- **NFR7**: The application must be cross-platform compatible (Linux, macOS, Windows)

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Create a clean, intuitive terminal interface that provides immediate feedback and maintains calculation history. The interface should be accessible to both technical users and those unfamiliar with command-line tools, with clear prompts and helpful error messages.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Interactive Mode**: Users enter calculations one at a time with immediate results
- **Batch Mode**: Users can provide calculations as command-line arguments
- **History Navigation**: Users can access previous calculations during the session
- **Clear Prompts**: Always show current state and expected input format
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Informative error messages that guide users to correct input

### Core Screens and Views
- **Main Calculator Interface**: Primary interactive calculation screen
- **Help Screen**: Display available commands and usage examples
- **History View**: Show session calculation history
- **Settings/Configuration**: Display current calculator settings and modes

### Accessibility: Terminal Standards
- High contrast default terminal colors
- Clear, readable text formatting
- Consistent prompt structure
- Screen reader compatible output
- Keyboard-only navigation support

### Branding
Minimal terminal branding with:
- Application name and version on startup
- Clean, professional appearance
- Optional ASCII art or colored text for visual interest
- Consistent formatting throughout

### Target Device and Platforms: Terminal Applications
- Linux Terminal (various shells)
- macOS Terminal/iTerm2
- Windows Command Prompt/PowerShell
- Cross-platform compatibility with standard ANSI escape codes

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Using a monorepo structure to contain both the calculator application and BMAD framework documentation, allowing for unified versioning and easier maintenance of the complete project ecosystem.

### Service Architecture
Single compiled executable with modular internal structure:
- Core calculation engine
- Command-line interface handler
- Input/output formatting module
- History management system
- Error handling subsystem

### Testing Requirements: Full Testing Pyramid
Comprehensive testing approach including:
- Unit tests for individual calculation functions
- Integration tests for CLI interface and user flows
- End-to-end tests for complete user scenarios
- Manual testing for edge cases and usability

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- **Language**: Go (Golang) 1.21+ for compiled executables, excellent performance, and cross-platform support
- **Dependencies**: Minimal external dependencies, leveraging Go's robust standard library
- **Package Management**: Go modules for dependency management
- **Build System**: Simple `go build` for creating platform-specific executables
- **Documentation**: Integrated with BMAD framework documentation standards
- **Version Control**: Git with conventional commit messages
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for cross-platform compilation and testing
- **Deployment**: Compiled executables for Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Logging**: Structured logging using Go's standard log package
- **Configuration**: Environment variables and optional config file support
- **Distribution**: GitHub releases with pre-compiled binaries for major platforms
