## Minimum Viable Calculator (MVC) - Version 1.0

### Core Features (Must Have)
1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**
   - Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/)
   - Decimal number support
   - Basic expression parsing (left-to-right, no precedence)

2. **Simple TUI Interface**
   - Visual calculator layout with buttons
   - Display screen for current expression and results
   - Keyboard input support
   - Basic mouse click support

3. **Local File Storage**
   - Simple JSON file for calculation history
   - Session persistence
   - No concurrent access handling (single-user)

4. **Basic Configuration**
   - Decimal precision setting
   - History size limit
   - Simple YAML config file

### Nice to Have (If Time)
1. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - Enter for equals
   - Escape for clear
   - Arrow keys for history navigation

2. **Basic Error Handling**
   - Division by zero detection
   - Invalid expression messages
   - Simple error display

3. **History Management**
   - View previous calculations
   - Basic history navigation
   - Clear history function

## Development Workflow (Local Focus)

### Phase 1: Core Calculator (Week 1-2)
```
Day 1-2: Basic calculation engine
Day 3-4: Simple expression parser
Day 5-6: TUI button layout
Day 7-8: Display and input handling
```

### Phase 2: File Operations (Week 3)
```
Day 9-10: JSON history storage
Day 11-12: Configuration system
Day 13-14: Session persistence
```

### Phase 3: Polish & Testing (Week 4)
```
Day 15-16: Basic error handling
Day 17-18: Keyboard shortcuts
Day 19-20: Final polish and documentation
```

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21+ installed locally
- Terminal with basic ANSI support
- Text editor for Go development
- Git for version control

### Development Commands
```bash
# Run calculator locally
go run cmd/calculator/main.go

# Build for local testing
go build -o calculator cmd/calculator/main.go
./calculator

# Run basic tests
go test ./...

# Format code
go fmt ./...
```

## Security Postponement Notes

### What's Deferred to Post-v1.0:
- AST-based expression parser (security fix)
- Comprehensive input validation
- Fuzz testing and security scanning
- Terminal compatibility matrix
- Concurrent access handling
- Advanced file permissions
- Cross-platform build validation
- Memory exhaustion protection

### Why This Approach:
- **Faster Time to Market**: Functional calculator in 4 weeks
- **User Feedback Early**: Get real usage data before complex features
- **Learning Opportunity**: Understand actual usage patterns
- **Lower Complexity**: Focus on core functionality first
- **Iterative Improvement**: Add security based on real needs

## Success Metrics for v1.0

### Functional Goals
- âœ… Basic arithmetic operations working correctly
- âœ… Visual TUI interface with mouse/keyboard support
- âœ… Local file storage for history
- âœ… Simple configuration system
- âœ… Runs locally on developer's machine

### User Experience Goals
- âœ… Calculator feels responsive and intuitive
- âœ… Basic error messages are helpful
- âœ… History is accessible and useful
- âœ… Configuration is easy to understand

### Technical Goals
- âœ… Clean code structure for future expansion
- âœ… Basic test coverage for core functionality
- âœ… Documentation for setup and usage
- âœ… No critical bugs in basic operations

## Post-v1.0 Security Roadmap

### Phase 1: Security Hardening (v1.1)
- Implement AST-based expression parser
- Add comprehensive input validation
- Create security-focused test suite

### Phase 2: Robustness (v1.2)
- Terminal compatibility testing
- Cross-platform build validation
- Concurrent access handling

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (v1.3+)
- Advanced mathematical operations
- Scientific calculator features
- Plugin system for extensions

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (Acceptable for v1.0)
- Basic expression parsing (no operator precedence)
- Simple file storage (no concurrent access)
- Limited terminal compatibility
- Basic error handling

### Monitoring Needed
- User feedback on usability issues
- Bug reports from real usage
- Performance with larger calculations
- File corruption scenarios

## Decision Rationale

This approach prioritizes:
1. **User Value**: Functional calculator over perfect security
2. **Learning**: Real usage data informs security needs
3. **Speed**: 4-week timeline vs. 12-week security-first approach
4. **Pragmatism**: Good enough for local development use

The security postponement is acceptable because:
- Single-user local application (low attack surface)
- No network access (no remote exploitation)
- File access limited to user's home directory
- No sensitive data processing
