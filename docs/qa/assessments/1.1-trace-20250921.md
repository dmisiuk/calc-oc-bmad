- Priority distribution: P0: 6, P1: 0, P2: 0

## Requirement Mappings

### AC1: Go module initialized with proper go.mod file

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `test/unit/setup_test.go::TestGoModuleInitialization`
  - Given: Project root directory without go.mod
  - When: Go module initialization command is executed
  - Then: go.mod file exists with correct module name 'calculator' and Go version 1.21+

- **Integration Test**: `test/integration/structure_test.go::TestModuleStructure`
  - Given: Initialized Go module
  - When: Module structure is validated
  - Then: go.mod contains proper dependencies and version constraints

### AC2: Basic project directory structure created

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Integration Test**: `test/integration/structure_test.go::TestDirectoryStructure`
  - Given: Project root directory
  - When: Directory creation commands are executed
  - Then: All required directories exist (cmd/, internal/, pkg/, test/, docs/, scripts/, configs/)

- **Unit Test**: `test/unit/setup_test.go::TestDirectoryExistence`
  - Given: Expected directory paths from unified-project-structure.md
  - When: Directory existence is checked
  - Then: All specified directories are present and accessible

### AC3: Git repository initialized with conventional commit setup

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **E2E Test**: `test/e2e/git_test.go::TestGitInitialization`
  - Given: Project root directory
  - When: Git initialization commands are executed
  - Then: .git directory exists and initial commit is created

- **E2E Test**: `test/e2e/git_test.go::TestConventionalCommits`
  - Given: Git repository with initial commit
  - When: Commit message format is validated
  - Then: Commit follows conventional commit format (feat: initial project setup)

### AC4: Basic README.md with project description and setup instructions

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `test/unit/setup_test.go::TestReadmeContent`
  - Given: Project root directory
  - When: README.md file is created
  - Then: README.md contains project description, installation instructions, and usage examples

- **Integration Test**: `test/integration/structure_test.go::TestDocumentationFiles`
  - Given: Documentation requirements from architecture
  - When: README.md content is validated
  - Then: All required sections are present and accurate

### AC5: Initial .gitignore file configured for Go projects

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `test/unit/setup_test.go::TestGitignoreContent`
  - Given: Project root directory
  - When: .gitignore file is created
  - Then: .gitignore contains Go-specific ignores, IDE files, OS files, and build artifacts

- **Integration Test**: `test/integration/structure_test.go::TestGitConfiguration`
  - Given: Git repository setup
  - When: .gitignore rules are applied
  - Then: Sensitive and build files are properly ignored

### AC6: GitHub repository created and linked

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **E2E Test**: `test/e2e/git_test.go::TestGitHubRepository`
  - Given: Local Git repository
  - When: GitHub repository creation and linking commands are executed
  - Then: GitHub repository exists, remote origin is set, and initial commit is pushed

- **E2E Test**: `test/e2e/git_test.go::TestRepositoryAccessibility`
  - Given: GitHub repository URL
  - When: Repository accessibility is verified
  - Then: Repository is publicly accessible and contains initial commit

## Coverage Analysis

### Test Level Distribution

- Unit Tests: 4 scenarios (covering module, directories, README, .gitignore validation)
- Integration Tests: 3 scenarios (covering structure, documentation, Git configuration)
- E2E Tests: 3 scenarios (covering Git init, conventional commits, GitHub integration)

### Risk Coverage

All high-risk setup items are covered by tests:

- Go version compatibility: Tested in module initialization
- Directory structure accuracy: Tested in structure validation
- Git setup reliability: Tested in Git initialization
- Documentation completeness: Tested in README validation
- Security configuration: Tested in .gitignore validation
- Repository accessibility: Tested in GitHub integration

## Critical Gaps

No critical gaps identified. All acceptance criteria have corresponding test coverage at appropriate levels.

## Test Design Recommendations

### Additional Test Scenarios (Optional)

1. **Cross-platform compatibility testing**
   - Test directory creation on Windows, macOS, Linux
   - Verify .gitignore works across platforms

2. **Go version edge case testing**
   - Test with minimum supported version (1.21.0)
   - Test with latest patch version

3. **GitHub API failure handling**
   - Test repository creation when GitHub API is unavailable
   - Test authentication failure scenarios

## Integration with Gates

This traceability demonstrates 100% coverage of all acceptance criteria with appropriate test levels. No gaps requiring FAIL status.
