## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Precision validation tests for all operations (15-digit accuracy)
- Performance benchmark tests (<50ms target)
- Expression parsing edge case tests
- Math/big integration tests

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Error handling integration tests
- Complex calculation workflows
- Input validation boundary tests

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Memory usage monitoring tests
- Security input sanitization tests
- Standard functional tests

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- Critical risks mitigated through Tasks 9-11
- High risks (score 6) monitored during implementation
- Precision and performance validation implemented via Tasks 9-10

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with monitoring in place
- Low risks documented and tracked

### Accepted Risks

- Minimal performance impact for edge cases (documented limitation)
- Memory usage for extremely large numbers (user education)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Calculation accuracy metrics
- Performance response times
- Error rates by operation type
- Memory usage patterns

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Math library changes or updates
- Performance requirements change
- New calculation operations added
- User feedback indicates accuracy issues

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Execute Task 9**: Implement Precision Validation Framework with validation utilities and tests
2. **Execute Task 10**: Set Up Performance Benchmarking with baseline tests and monitoring
3. **Execute Task 11**: Simplify Expression Parser to reduce complexity risks
4. **Monitor Implementation**: Track risk mitigation effectiveness during development

### Development Focus

- Prioritize precision and performance in code reviews
- Include accuracy validation in all testing phases
- Monitor math/big usage patterns for optimization opportunities

### Testing Strategy

- 70% unit test coverage on calculation logic
- 20% integration test coverage on workflows
- 10% performance and accuracy validation tests
- Automated precision checking in CI/CD pipeline
