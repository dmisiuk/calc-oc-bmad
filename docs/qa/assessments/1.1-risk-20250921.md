## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description | Category | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority | Mitigation Strategy |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------------|--------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| TECH-001 | Go version incompatibility preventing module initialization | Technical | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High | Verify Go 1.21+ installation before setup; include version check in setup script |
| TECH-002 | Directory structure mismatch with unified-project-structure.md | Technical | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High | Cross-reference structure against architecture doc; create validation script |
| TECH-003 | Go module name conflicts or invalid naming | Technical | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low | Use standard naming convention; validate module name format |
| SEC-001 | Sensitive files not excluded by .gitignore | Security | Low (1) | High (3) | 3 | Medium | Include comprehensive .gitignore template; audit before first commit |
| BUS-001 | Project setup delays blocking all future development | Business | Low (1) | High (3) | 3 | Medium | Plan setup as high-priority task; have backup setup procedures |
| OPS-001 | GitHub repository creation/access issues | Operational | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low | Verify GitHub access beforehand; have alternative hosting options |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

None required.

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- **TECH-001**: Integration test verifying Go version compatibility and module initialization
- **TECH-002**: Integration test validating directory structure against architecture specification

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **SEC-001**: Unit test verifying .gitignore contains required security exclusions
- **OPS-001**: E2E test for GitHub repository creation and linking

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All high-risk items (score ≥ 6)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium-risk items with documented mitigation plans

### Accepted Risks

- Low-risk items (score ≤ 3) accepted as normal project setup variance

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-setup monitoring for:

- Go build/test execution success rates
- Directory structure compliance over time
- Git repository health and accessibility

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Go version updates become available
- Architecture document changes
- GitHub access policies change
- Setup process encounters issues

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Verify Go Environment**: Run `go version` and confirm 1.21+ before starting setup
2. **Prepare GitHub Access**: Ensure repository creation permissions are confirmed
3. **Review Architecture**: Double-check unified-project-structure.md for any recent changes

### Mitigation Implementation

1. **Create Setup Validation Script**: Automate verification of Go version, directory structure, and basic functionality
2. **Use Comprehensive .gitignore**: Start with Go-specific template and customize for project needs
3. **Document Backup Procedures**: Have manual setup steps if automated scripts fail

### Testing Focus

- Integration tests for setup verification
- E2E tests for GitHub integration
- Unit tests for configuration file validation
