# Epic 2: Enhanced Features & User Experience

**Goal**: Implement calculation history, improved error handling, and batch processing capabilities to enhance user productivity and make the calculator more powerful for regular use.

## Story 2.1: Calculation History [PRIORITY: MEDIUM] [PARALLEL with 2.2]
**As a** user,
**I want** to see my calculation history during the session,
**so that** I can review previous calculations and reuse results.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Store calculation history in memory during session
2. Display history command with formatted output
3. Support for navigating through history items
4. Ability to reuse previous results in new calculations
5. Clear history command to reset session history
6. History persists until application exit

## Story 2.2: Batch Processing Mode [PRIORITY: MEDIUM] [PARALLEL with 2.1]
**As a** user,
**I want** to provide calculations as command-line arguments,
**so that** I can use the calculator in scripts and automation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Command-line argument parsing for single calculations
2. Support for multiple calculations in one command
3. Results output in a script-friendly format
4. Quiet mode for reduced output in automated scenarios
5. Error handling appropriate for batch processing
6. Integration with existing interactive mode

## Story 2.3: Enhanced Error Handling [PRIORITY: LOW] [SEQUENTIAL: after 1.4]
**As a** user,
**I want** more detailed error messages and suggestions,
**so that** I can quickly understand and fix my mistakes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Detailed error context showing exactly what went wrong
2. Suggestions for correct input format
3. Error severity levels (warning vs error)
4. Error codes for programmatic handling
5. Graceful degradation for unexpected errors
6. Logging support for debugging purposes

## Story 2.4: User Configuration [PRIORITY: LOW] [PARALLEL with 2.3]
**As a** user,
**I want** to customize some calculator settings,
**so that** I can tailor the experience to my preferences.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Configuration file support for user preferences
2. Environment variable override capability
3. Configurable precision settings
4. Optional color output for terminal
5. Persistent history configuration
6. Default value settings for calculations
