# Epic 3: Testing & Quality Assurance

**Goal**: Comprehensive testing implementation including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing framework to ensure reliability and maintainability.

## Story 3.1: Unit Test Coverage [PRIORITY: HIGH] [PARALLEL with development stories]
**As a** developer,
**I want** comprehensive unit tests for all core functionality,
**so that** I can ensure individual components work correctly and facilitate future maintenance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Unit tests for all calculation functions with 90%+ coverage
2. Edge case testing (large numbers, decimals, special values)
3. Mock testing for external dependencies
4. Benchmark tests for performance validation
5. Test documentation with clear test scenarios
6. Integration with Go's testing framework

## Story 3.2: Integration Testing [PRIORITY: MEDIUM] [SEQUENTIAL: after 1.3 and 2.2]
**As a** developer,
**I want** integration tests for user workflows and CLI interactions,
**so that** I can verify that components work together correctly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. End-to-end test for interactive mode workflow
2. Batch processing integration tests
3. History management integration tests
4. Error handling integration scenarios
5. Configuration loading and validation tests
6. Cross-platform compatibility testing

## Story 3.3: CI/CD Pipeline [PRIORITY: MEDIUM] [PARALLEL with 3.2]
**As a** developer,
**I want** automated testing and validation on code changes,
**so that** I can maintain code quality and catch issues early.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
2. Cross-platform build validation (Linux, macOS, Windows)
3. Code quality checks and linting
4. Test coverage reporting
5. Automated documentation generation
6. Release automation for new versions
