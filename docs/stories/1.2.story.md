### Data Models

Use Calculation struct from docs/architecture/data-models.md:

```go
type Calculation struct {
    ID        string      `json:"id"`
    Expression string      `json:"expression"`
    Result    float64     `json:"result"`
    Timestamp time.Time   `json:"timestamp"`
    Operation string      `json:"operation"`
    Operands  []float64   `json:"operands"`
    Error     string      `json:"error,omitempty"`
}
```

Key attributes for this story:
- expression: The mathematical expression entered by the user
- result: The calculated result with 15-digit precision
- operation: The type of operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- operands: The numbers used in the calculation
- error: Error message if calculation failed (e.g., division by zero)

### API Specifications

No external APIs required. The calculation engine provides internal interfaces:

- `Calculate(expression string) (float64, error)` - Parse and calculate expressions
- `Validate(expression string) error` - Validate mathematical expression syntax
- `GetSupportedOperations() []string` - List available operations

### Component Specifications

CalculationEngine component from docs/architecture/components.md:

**Responsibility:** Core mathematical calculation logic and operation handling

**Key Interfaces:**
- `Calculate(expression string) (float64, error)` - Parse and calculate expressions
- `Validate(expression string) error` - Validate mathematical expression syntax
- `GetSupportedOperations() []string` - List available operations

**Dependencies:** None (pure calculation logic)

**Technology Stack:** Go 1.21+ with math/big for precision arithmetic

### File Locations

Based on unified-project-structure.md:

func TestCalculationEngine_Add(t *testing.T) {
    engine := NewCalculationEngine()
    
    result, err := engine.Calculate("2 + 3")
    if err != nil {
        t.Errorf("Unexpected error: %v", err)
    }
    
    if result != 5 {
        t.Errorf("Expected 5, got %f", result)
    }
}
```

### Risk Assessment Update

**Critical Risk Mitigation Evaluation:**

The addition of Tasks 9-11 adequately addresses the previously identified critical risks:

- **Task 9 (Precision Validation Framework)**: Directly mitigates TECH-001 precision loss risk by implementing validation utilities, precision checking functions, and integration into all calculation methods. Risk score reduced from 9 (Critical) to 6 (High).

- **Task 10 (Performance Benchmarking)**: Directly mitigates PERF-001 performance violations by setting up baseline tests, performance monitoring, and optimization tracking. Risk score reduced from 9 (Critical) to 6 (High).

- **Task 11 (Simplify Expression Parser)**: Addresses TECH-002 parsing complexity by reviewing and simplifying parsing logic. Risk score reduced from 6 (High) to 3 (Low).

**Updated Risk Profile:**
- Critical Risks: 0 (previously 2)
- High Risks: 4 (previously 3)
- Overall Risk Score: 66/100 (improved from 65/100)
- Risk Status: Moderate - significantly improved with mitigation tasks

### Quality Gate Update

**Gate Status Change:** FAIL → CONCERNS

**Rationale for CONCERNS:**
- Critical risks (score ≥9) eliminated through mitigation tasks
- High-risk items (score 6) remain but are actively mitigated
- Implementation monitoring required for Tasks 9-11 effectiveness
- No blocking issues, but oversight needed during development

**Gate Decision Factors:**
- Risk mitigation: Critical risks addressed → supports gate improvement
- NFR Status: Performance remains CONCERNS but with monitoring plan
- Test Coverage: Comprehensive (24 scenarios) with full AC coverage
- Technical Debt: Low, with mitigation tasks reducing future debt

### Implementation Recommendations

**Priority Execution Order:**
1. **Task 9**: Implement precision validation framework first (foundation for accuracy)
2. **Task 10**: Set up performance benchmarking concurrently (early monitoring)
3. **Task 11**: Simplify expression parser as needed (reduce complexity)
4. **Tasks 1-8**: Execute core functionality with validation frameworks in place

**Monitoring Requirements:**
- Track precision validation effectiveness in unit tests
- Monitor performance benchmarks against 50ms target
- Validate expression parser simplification impact
- Report any risk mitigation gaps immediately

**Success Criteria for Mitigation:**
- Precision validation catches all accuracy issues in testing
- Performance benchmarks establish baseline <50ms for simple operations
- Expression parser handles all specified operations without complexity issues
- All mitigation tasks completed before integration testing
