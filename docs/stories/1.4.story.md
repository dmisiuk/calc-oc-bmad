# Story 1.4: Basic Error Handling

## Status: Draft

## Story

As a user,
I want clear error messages when I make mistakes,
so that I understand what went wrong and can correct my input.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Invalid input format detection and helpful error messages
2. Division by zero prevention with user-friendly explanation
3. Number overflow/underflow handling
4. Graceful handling of non-numeric input
5. Error recovery that allows continued use after errors

## Context Source

- Source Document: docs/prd/epic-1-foundation-core-calculator.md
- Enhancement Type: Error handling and user experience improvement
- Existing System Impact: Enhances CLI from Story 1.3 with robust error management

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 1.3 implements basic CLI REPL. This story enhances error handling to provide clear, helpful messages and ensure the application remains usable after errors.

### Data Models

Uses AppError struct from docs/architecture/error-handling-strategy.md for structured error responses:

- Code, Message, Details, Context fields
- Implements error interface

### API Specifications

Enhances CalculationEngine interface from docs/architecture/components.md with better error handling:

- Calculate returns structured errors
- Validation errors with specific codes

### Component Specifications

Following docs/architecture/error-handling-strategy.md:

- AppError struct for structured errors
- Frontend error display with colorized output
- Backend error wrapping with context

### File Locations

Following unified project structure from docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md:

- Error types: internal/models/error.go (new)
- Enhanced CLI: internal/terminal/cli.go (modify from 1.3)
- Enhanced engine: internal/calculation/engine.go (modify from 1.2)
- Error tests: test/unit/error_test.go, test/integration/error_handling_test.go

### Testing Requirements

Follow testing strategy from docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md:

- Unit tests for error creation and formatting
- Integration tests for error scenarios in CLI
- Test error recovery and continued operation

### Technical Constraints

- Use structured errors with codes and messages
- Follow error handling patterns from docs/architecture/error-handling-strategy.md
- Ensure errors are user-friendly, not technical
- Maintain application stability after errors
