# Story 1.1: Project Initialization

## Status: Ready for Review

## Story

As a developer,
I want to set up the Go project structure with proper module initialization,
so that I have a solid foundation for development and can leverage Go's package management.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Go module initialized with proper go.mod file
2. Basic project directory structure created
3. Git repository initialized with conventional commit setup
4. Basic README.md with project description and setup instructions
5. Initial .gitignore file configured for Go projects
6. GitHub repository created and linked

## Context Source

- Source Document: docs/prd/epic-1-foundation-core-calculator.md
- Enhancement Type: Project foundation setup
- Existing System Impact: New project initialization

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

No previous stories to review.

### Data Models

No specific data models required for project initialization. Future stories will use Calculation, History, and Configuration models as defined in docs/architecture/data-models.md.

### API Specifications

No API specifications required for this CLI application. The application uses TUI Events for user interface protocol as specified in docs/architecture/tech-stack.md.

### Component Specifications

No UI components required for this story. Future stories will implement terminal UI components using Tview framework as specified in docs/architecture/tech-stack.md.

### File Locations

Project structure must follow the unified project structure defined in docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md:

- Main application: cmd/calculator/main.go
- Internal packages: internal/calculation/, internal/terminal/, etc.
- Tests: test/unit/, test/integration/, test/e2e/
- Configuration: configs/default.yaml
- Documentation: docs/

### Testing Requirements

Follow testing strategy from docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md. For this story, focus on ensuring the project setup supports the testing pyramid structure.

### Technical Constraints

- Use Go 1.21+ as specified in docs/architecture/tech-stack.md
