# Story 1.1: Project Initialization

## Status: Draft

## Story

As a developer,
I want to set up the Go project structure with proper module initialization,
so that I have a solid foundation for development and can leverage Go's package management.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Go module initialized with proper go.mod file
2. Basic project directory structure created
3. Git repository initialized with conventional commit setup
4. Basic README.md with project description and setup instructions
5. Initial .gitignore file configured for Go projects
6. GitHub repository created and linked

## Context Source

- Source Document: docs/prd/epic-1-foundation-core-calculator.md
- Enhancement Type: Project foundation setup
- Existing System Impact: New project initialization

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

No previous stories to review.

### Data Models

No specific data models required for project initialization. Future stories will use Calculation, History, and Configuration models as defined in docs/architecture/data-models.md.

### API Specifications

No API specifications required for this CLI application. The application uses TUI Events for user interface protocol as specified in docs/architecture/tech-stack.md.

### Component Specifications

No UI components required for this story. Future stories will implement terminal UI components using Tview framework as specified in docs/architecture/tech-stack.md.

### File Locations

Project structure must follow the unified project structure defined in docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md:

- Main application: cmd/calculator/main.go
- Internal packages: internal/calculation/, internal/terminal/, etc.
- Tests: test/unit/, test/integration/, test/e2e/
- Configuration: configs/default.yaml
- Documentation: docs/

### Testing Requirements

Follow testing strategy from docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md. For this story, focus on ensuring the project setup supports the testing pyramid structure.

### Technical Constraints

- Use Go 1.21+ as specified in docs/architecture/tech-stack.md
- Follow coding standards from docs/architecture/coding-standards.md
- Use Go modules for dependency management
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Initialize Go module with proper go.mod file
  - [ ] Run `go mod init calculator` to create go.mod
  - [ ] Verify Go version 1.21+ in go.mod
  - [ ] Add basic module structure

- [ ] Create basic project directory structure following docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md
  - [ ] Create cmd/calculator/ directory
  - [ ] Create internal/ subdirectories (calculation/, terminal/, config/, history/, parser/, models/)
  - [ ] Create pkg/ subdirectories (calculator/, terminal/)
  - [ ] Create test/ subdirectories (unit/, integration/, e2e/)
  - [ ] Create docs/, scripts/, configs/ directories

- [ ] Initialize Git repository with conventional commit setup
  - [ ] Run `git init` in project root
  - [ ] Create initial commit with project structure
  - [ ] Set up conventional commit format (future commits)

- [ ] Create basic README.md with project description and setup instructions
  - [ ] Include project overview as terminal calculator
  - [ ] Add installation instructions for Go 1.21+
  - [ ] Include basic usage examples
  - [ ] Add development setup steps

- [ ] Create initial .gitignore file configured for Go projects
  - [ ] Include standard Go ignores (bin/, *.exe, *.exe~, *.dll, *.so, *.dylib)
  - [ ] Add IDE-specific ignores (.vscode/, .idea/)
  - [ ] Include OS-specific ignores (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db)
  - [ ] Add build artifacts and temporary files

- [ ] Create GitHub repository and link local repository
  - [ ] Create new repository on GitHub
  - [ ] Add GitHub remote origin
  - [ ] Push initial commit to GitHub
  - [ ] Verify repository is accessible

- [ ] Verify project setup supports testing strategy from docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md
  - [ ] Ensure test directories are created
  - [ ] Verify Go testing framework is available
  - [ ] Test basic go build and go test commands

## Testing

- Unit tests: Verify go.mod is properly initialized
- Integration tests: Verify directory structure matches unified-project-structure.md
- E2E tests: Verify git repository is properly set up and GitHub linked
