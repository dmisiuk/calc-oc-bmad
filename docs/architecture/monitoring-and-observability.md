# Monitoring and Observability

## Monitoring Stack

- **Frontend Monitoring:** Structured logging with timestamps and request IDs
- **Backend Monitoring:** Performance metrics, error tracking, and usage statistics
- **Error Tracking:** Centralized error logging with stack traces
- **Performance Monitoring:** Calculation timing and memory usage tracking

## Key Metrics

**Frontend Metrics:**
- Application startup time
- Input processing time
- Terminal rendering performance
- Memory usage during operation

**Backend Metrics:**
- Calculation execution time
- Error rates by operation type
- History storage performance
- Configuration load/save times
