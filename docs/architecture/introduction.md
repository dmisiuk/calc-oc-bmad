# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for Calculator, including the backend calculation engine, terminal-based user interface, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern terminal-based applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.
