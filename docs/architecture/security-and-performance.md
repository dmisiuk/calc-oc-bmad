# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- Input validation for all user expressions
- Safe handling of special characters in terminal
- Protection against buffer overflow attacks
- Secure file operations for history and config

**Backend Security:**
- Memory safety through Go's type system
- Safe math operations with proper overflow handling
- Secure string parsing and validation
- Protection against code injection

**Authentication Security:**
- No authentication required for local application
- Optional file permissions for shared installations

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Application startup time under 100ms
- Calculation results within 50ms
- Efficient terminal rendering
- Minimal memory footprint

**Backend Performance:**
- Optimized mathematical operations
- Efficient memory usage for large histories
- Fast file I/O for persistence
- Responsive input handling
